# Not f cat on L ght Ranker Model

## Model Context
T re are 4 major components of Tw ter not f cat ons recom ndat on system: 1) cand date generat on 2) l ght rank ng 3)  avy rank ng & 4) qual y control. T  not f cat on l ght ranker model br dges cand date generat on and  avy rank ng by pre-select ng h ghly-relevant cand dates from t   n  al huge cand date pool.  â€™s a l ght-  ght model to reduce system cost dur ng  avy rank ng w hout hurt ng user exper ence.
