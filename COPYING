 Copyr ght (C) 2007 Free Software Foundat on,  nc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone  s perm ted to copy and d str bute verbat m cop es
 of t  l cense docu nt, but chang ng    s not allo d.

                            Preamble

  T  GNU Affero General Publ c L cense  s a free, copyleft l cense for
software and ot r k nds of works, spec f cally des gned to ensure
cooperat on w h t  commun y  n t  case of network server software.

  T  l censes for most software and ot r pract cal works are des gned
to take away y  freedom to share and change t  works.  By contrast,
  General Publ c L censes are  ntended to guarantee y  freedom to
share and change all vers ons of a program--to make sure   rema ns free
software for all  s users.

  W n   speak of free software,   are referr ng to freedom, not
pr ce.    General Publ c L censes are des gned to make sure that  
have t  freedom to d str bute cop es of free software (and charge for
t m  f   w sh), that   rece ve s ce code or can get    f  
want  , that   can change t  software or use p eces of    n new
free programs, and that   know   can do t se th ngs.

  Developers that use   General Publ c L censes protect y  r ghts
w h two steps: (1) assert copyr ght on t  software, and (2) offer
  t  L cense wh ch g ves   legal perm ss on to copy, d str bute
and/or mod fy t  software.

  A secondary benef  of defend ng all users' freedom  s that
 mprove nts made  n alternate vers ons of t  program,  f t y
rece ve w despread use, beco  ava lable for ot r developers to
 ncorporate.  Many developers of free software are  artened and
enc aged by t  result ng cooperat on.  Ho ver,  n t  case of
software used on network servers, t  result may fa l to co  about.
T  GNU General Publ c L cense perm s mak ng a mod f ed vers on and
lett ng t  publ c access   on a server w hout ever releas ng  s
s ce code to t  publ c.

  T  GNU Affero General Publ c L cense  s des gned spec f cally to
ensure that,  n such cases, t  mod f ed s ce code beco s ava lable
to t  commun y.    requ res t  operator of a network server to
prov de t  s ce code of t  mod f ed vers on runn ng t re to t 
users of that server.  T refore, publ c use of a mod f ed vers on, on
a publ cly access ble server, g ves t  publ c access to t  s ce
code of t  mod f ed vers on.

  An older l cense, called t  Affero General Publ c L cense and
publ s d by Affero, was des gned to accompl sh s m lar goals.  T   s
a d fferent l cense, not a vers on of t  Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new vers on of t  Affero GPL wh ch perm s rel cens ng under
t  l cense.

  T  prec se terms and cond  ons for copy ng, d str but on and
mod f cat on follow.

                       TERMS AND COND T ONS

  0. Def n  ons.

  "T  L cense" refers to vers on 3 of t  GNU Affero General Publ c L cense.

  "Copyr ght" also  ans copyr ght-l ke laws that apply to ot r k nds of
works, such as sem conductor masks.

  "T  Program" refers to any copyr ghtable work l censed under t 
L cense.  Each l censee  s addressed as " ".  "L censees" and
"rec p ents" may be  nd v duals or organ zat ons.

  To "mod fy" a work  ans to copy from or adapt all or part of t  work
 n a fash on requ r ng copyr ght perm ss on, ot r than t  mak ng of an
exact copy.  T  result ng work  s called a "mod f ed vers on" of t 
earl er work or a work "based on" t  earl er work.

  A "covered work"  ans e  r t  unmod f ed Program or a work based
on t  Program.

  To "propagate" a work  ans to do anyth ng w h   that, w hout
perm ss on, would make   d rectly or secondar ly l able for
 nfr nge nt under appl cable copyr ght law, except execut ng   on a
computer or mod fy ng a pr vate copy.  Propagat on  ncludes copy ng,
d str but on (w h or w hout mod f cat on), mak ng ava lable to t 
publ c, and  n so  countr es ot r act v  es as  ll.

  To "convey" a work  ans any k nd of propagat on that enables ot r
part es to make or rece ve cop es.   re  nteract on w h a user through
a computer network, w h no transfer of a copy,  s not convey ng.

  An  nteract ve user  nterface d splays "Appropr ate Legal Not ces"
to t  extent that    ncludes a conven ent and prom nently v s ble
feature that (1) d splays an appropr ate copyr ght not ce, and (2)
tells t  user that t re  s no warranty for t  work (except to t 
extent that warrant es are prov ded), that l censees may convey t 
work under t  L cense, and how to v ew a copy of t  L cense.   f
t   nterface presents a l st of user commands or opt ons, such as a
 nu, a prom nent  em  n t  l st  ets t  cr er on.

  1. S ce Code.

  T  "s ce code" for a work  ans t  preferred form of t  work
for mak ng mod f cat ons to  .  "Object code"  ans any non-s ce
form of a work.

  A "Standard  nterface"  ans an  nterface that e  r  s an off c al
standard def ned by a recogn zed standards body, or,  n t  case of
 nterfaces spec f ed for a part cular programm ng language, one that
 s w dely used among developers work ng  n that language.

  T  "System L brar es" of an executable work  nclude anyth ng, ot r
than t  work as a whole, that (a)  s  ncluded  n t  normal form of
packag ng a Major Component, but wh ch  s not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of t  work w h that
Major Component, or to  mple nt a Standard  nterface for wh ch an
 mple ntat on  s ava lable to t  publ c  n s ce code form.  A
"Major Component",  n t  context,  ans a major essent al component
(kernel, w ndow system, and so on) of t  spec f c operat ng system
( f any) on wh ch t  executable work runs, or a comp ler used to
produce t  work, or an object code  nterpreter used to run  .

  T  "Correspond ng S ce" for a work  n object code form  ans all
t  s ce code needed to generate,  nstall, and (for an executable
work) run t  object code and to mod fy t  work,  nclud ng scr pts to
control those act v  es.  Ho ver,   does not  nclude t  work's
System L brar es, or general-purpose tools or generally ava lable free
programs wh ch are used unmod f ed  n perform ng those act v  es but
wh ch are not part of t  work.  For example, Correspond ng S ce
 ncludes  nterface def n  on f les assoc ated w h s ce f les for
t  work, and t  s ce code for shared l brar es and dynam cally
l nked subprograms that t  work  s spec f cally des gned to requ re,
such as by  nt mate data commun cat on or control flow bet en those
subprograms and ot r parts of t  work.

  T  Correspond ng S ce need not  nclude anyth ng that users
can regenerate automat cally from ot r parts of t  Correspond ng
S ce.

  T  Correspond ng S ce for a work  n s ce code form  s that
sa  work.

  2. Bas c Perm ss ons.

  All r ghts granted under t  L cense are granted for t  term of
copyr ght on t  Program, and are  rrevocable prov ded t  stated
cond  ons are  t.  T  L cense expl c ly aff rms y  unl m ed
perm ss on to run t  unmod f ed Program.  T  output from runn ng a
covered work  s covered by t  L cense only  f t  output, g ven  s
content, const utes a covered work.  T  L cense acknowledges y 
r ghts of fa r use or ot r equ valent, as prov ded by copyr ght law.

    may make, run and propagate covered works that   do not
convey, w hout cond  ons so long as y  l cense ot rw se rema ns
 n force.    may convey covered works to ot rs for t  sole purpose
of hav ng t m make mod f cat ons exclus vely for  , or prov de  
w h fac l  es for runn ng those works, prov ded that   comply w h
t  terms of t  L cense  n convey ng all mater al for wh ch   do
not control copyr ght.  Those thus mak ng or runn ng t  covered works
for   must do so exclus vely on y  behalf, under y  d rect on
and control, on terms that proh b  t m from mak ng any cop es of
y  copyr ghted mater al outs de t  r relat onsh p w h  .

  Convey ng under any ot r c rcumstances  s perm ted solely under
t  cond  ons stated below.  Subl cens ng  s not allo d; sect on 10
makes   unnecessary.

  3. Protect ng Users' Legal R ghts From Ant -C rcumvent on Law.

  No covered work shall be dee d part of an effect ve technolog cal
 asure under any appl cable law fulf ll ng obl gat ons under art cle
11 of t  W PO copyr ght treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
s m lar laws proh b  ng or restr ct ng c rcumvent on of such
 asures.

  W n   convey a covered work,   wa ve any legal po r to forb d
c rcumvent on of technolog cal  asures to t  extent such c rcumvent on
 s effected by exerc s ng r ghts under t  L cense w h respect to
t  covered work, and   d scla m any  ntent on to l m  operat on or
mod f cat on of t  work as a  ans of enforc ng, aga nst t  work's
users, y  or th rd part es' legal r ghts to forb d c rcumvent on of
technolog cal  asures.

  4. Convey ng Verbat m Cop es.

    may convey verbat m cop es of t  Program's s ce code as  
rece ve  ,  n any  d um, prov ded that   consp cuously and
appropr ately publ sh on each copy an appropr ate copyr ght not ce;
keep  ntact all not ces stat ng that t  L cense and any
non-perm ss ve terms added  n accord w h sect on 7 apply to t  code;
keep  ntact all not ces of t  absence of any warranty; and g ve all
rec p ents a copy of t  L cense along w h t  Program.

    may charge any pr ce or no pr ce for each copy that   convey,
and   may offer support or warranty protect on for a fee.

  5. Convey ng Mod f ed S ce Vers ons.

    may convey a work based on t  Program, or t  mod f cat ons to
produce   from t  Program,  n t  form of s ce code under t 
terms of sect on 4, prov ded that   also  et all of t se cond  ons:

    a) T  work must carry prom nent not ces stat ng that   mod f ed
     , and g v ng a relevant date.

    b) T  work must carry prom nent not ces stat ng that    s
    released under t  L cense and any cond  ons added under sect on
    7.  T  requ re nt mod f es t  requ re nt  n sect on 4 to
    "keep  ntact all not ces".

    c)   must l cense t  ent re work, as a whole, under t 
    L cense to anyone who co s  nto possess on of a copy.  T 
    L cense w ll t refore apply, along w h any appl cable sect on 7
    add  onal terms, to t  whole of t  work, and all  s parts,
    regardless of how t y are packaged.  T  L cense g ves no
    perm ss on to l cense t  work  n any ot r way, but   does not
     nval date such perm ss on  f   have separately rece ved  .

    d)  f t  work has  nteract ve user  nterfaces, each must d splay
    Appropr ate Legal Not ces; ho ver,  f t  Program has  nteract ve
     nterfaces that do not d splay Appropr ate Legal Not ces, y 
    work need not make t m do so.

  A comp lat on of a covered work w h ot r separate and  ndependent
works, wh ch are not by t  r nature extens ons of t  covered work,
and wh ch are not comb ned w h   such as to form a larger program,
 n or on a volu  of a storage or d str but on  d um,  s called an
"aggregate"  f t  comp lat on and  s result ng copyr ght are not
used to l m  t  access or legal r ghts of t  comp lat on's users
beyond what t   nd v dual works perm .   nclus on of a covered work
 n an aggregate does not cause t  L cense to apply to t  ot r
parts of t  aggregate.

  6. Convey ng Non-S ce Forms.

    may convey a covered work  n object code form under t  terms
of sect ons 4 and 5, prov ded that   also convey t 
mach ne-readable Correspond ng S ce under t  terms of t  L cense,
 n one of t se ways:

    a) Convey t  object code  n, or embod ed  n, a phys cal product
    ( nclud ng a phys cal d str but on  d um), accompan ed by t 
    Correspond ng S ce f xed on a durable phys cal  d um
    customar ly used for software  nterchange.

    b) Convey t  object code  n, or embod ed  n, a phys cal product
    ( nclud ng a phys cal d str but on  d um), accompan ed by a
    wr ten offer, val d for at least three years and val d for as
    long as   offer spare parts or custo r support for that product
    model, to g ve anyone who possesses t  object code e  r (1) a
    copy of t  Correspond ng S ce for all t  software  n t 
    product that  s covered by t  L cense, on a durable phys cal
     d um customar ly used for software  nterchange, for a pr ce no
    more than y  reasonable cost of phys cally perform ng t 
    convey ng of s ce, or (2) access to copy t 
    Correspond ng S ce from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey  nd v dual cop es of t  object code w h a copy of t 
    wr ten offer to prov de t  Correspond ng S ce.  T 
    alternat ve  s allo d only occas onally and noncom rc ally, and
    only  f   rece ved t  object code w h such an offer,  n accord
    w h subsect on 6b.

    d) Convey t  object code by offer ng access from a des gnated
    place (grat s or for a charge), and offer equ valent access to t 
    Correspond ng S ce  n t  sa  way through t  sa  place at no
    furt r charge.    need not requ re rec p ents to copy t 
    Correspond ng S ce along w h t  object code.   f t  place to
    copy t  object code  s a network server, t  Correspond ng S ce
    may be on a d fferent server (operated by   or a th rd party)
    that supports equ valent copy ng fac l  es, prov ded   ma nta n
    clear d rect ons next to t  object code say ng w re to f nd t 
    Correspond ng S ce.  Regardless of what server hosts t 
    Correspond ng S ce,   rema n obl gated to ensure that    s
    ava lable for as long as needed to sat sfy t se requ re nts.

    e) Convey t  object code us ng peer-to-peer transm ss on, prov ded
       nform ot r peers w re t  object code and Correspond ng
    S ce of t  work are be ng offered to t  general publ c at no
    charge under subsect on 6d.

  A separable port on of t  object code, whose s ce code  s excluded
from t  Correspond ng S ce as a System L brary, need not be
 ncluded  n convey ng t  object code work.

  A "User Product"  s e  r (1) a "consu r product", wh ch  ans any
tang ble personal property wh ch  s normally used for personal, fam ly,
or household purposes, or (2) anyth ng des gned or sold for  ncorporat on
 nto a d ll ng.   n determ n ng w t r a product  s a consu r product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved  n favor of coverage.  For a part cular
product rece ved by a part cular user, "normally used" refers to a
typ cal or common use of that class of product, regardless of t  status
of t  part cular user or of t  way  n wh ch t  part cular user
actually uses, or expects or  s expected to use, t  product.  A product
 s a consu r product regardless of w t r t  product has substant al
com rc al,  ndustr al or non-consu r uses, unless such uses represent
t  only s gn f cant mode of use of t  product.

  " nstallat on  nformat on" for a User Product  ans any  thods,
procedures, author zat on keys, or ot r  nformat on requ red to  nstall
and execute mod f ed vers ons of a covered work  n that User Product from
a mod f ed vers on of  s Correspond ng S ce.  T   nformat on must
suff ce to ensure that t  cont nued funct on ng of t  mod f ed object
code  s  n no case prevented or  nterfered w h solely because
mod f cat on has been made.

   f   convey an object code work under t  sect on  n, or w h, or
spec f cally for use  n, a User Product, and t  convey ng occurs as
part of a transact on  n wh ch t  r ght of possess on and use of t 
User Product  s transferred to t  rec p ent  n perpetu y or for a
f xed term (regardless of how t  transact on  s character zed), t 
Correspond ng S ce conveyed under t  sect on must be accompan ed
by t   nstallat on  nformat on.  But t  requ re nt does not apply
 f ne  r   nor any th rd party reta ns t  ab l y to  nstall
mod f ed object code on t  User Product (for example, t  work has
been  nstalled  n ROM).

  T  requ re nt to prov de  nstallat on  nformat on does not  nclude a
requ re nt to cont nue to prov de support serv ce, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been mod f ed or  nstalled by t  rec p ent, or for
t  User Product  n wh ch   has been mod f ed or  nstalled.  Access to a
network may be den ed w n t  mod f cat on  self mater ally and
adversely affects t  operat on of t  network or v olates t  rules and
protocols for commun cat on across t  network.

  Correspond ng S ce conveyed, and  nstallat on  nformat on prov ded,
 n accord w h t  sect on must be  n a format that  s publ cly
docu nted (and w h an  mple ntat on ava lable to t  publ c  n
s ce code form), and must requ re no spec al password or key for
unpack ng, read ng or copy ng.

  7. Add  onal Terms.

  "Add  onal perm ss ons" are terms that supple nt t  terms of t 
L cense by mak ng except ons from one or more of  s cond  ons.
Add  onal perm ss ons that are appl cable to t  ent re Program shall
be treated as though t y  re  ncluded  n t  L cense, to t  extent
that t y are val d under appl cable law.   f add  onal perm ss ons
apply only to part of t  Program, that part may be used separately
under those perm ss ons, but t  ent re Program rema ns governed by
t  L cense w hout regard to t  add  onal perm ss ons.

  W n   convey a copy of a covered work,   may at y  opt on
remove any add  onal perm ss ons from that copy, or from any part of
 .  (Add  onal perm ss ons may be wr ten to requ re t  r own
removal  n certa n cases w n   mod fy t  work.)    may place
add  onal perm ss ons on mater al, added by   to a covered work,
for wh ch   have or can g ve appropr ate copyr ght perm ss on.

  Notw hstand ng any ot r prov s on of t  L cense, for mater al  
add to a covered work,   may ( f author zed by t  copyr ght holders of
that mater al) supple nt t  terms of t  L cense w h terms:

    a) D scla m ng warranty or l m  ng l ab l y d fferently from t 
    terms of sect ons 15 and 16 of t  L cense; or

    b) Requ r ng preservat on of spec f ed reasonable legal not ces or
    author attr but ons  n that mater al or  n t  Appropr ate Legal
    Not ces d splayed by works conta n ng  ; or

    c) Proh b  ng m srepresentat on of t  or g n of that mater al, or
    requ r ng that mod f ed vers ons of such mater al be marked  n
    reasonable ways as d fferent from t  or g nal vers on; or

    d) L m  ng t  use for publ c y purposes of na s of l censors or
    authors of t  mater al; or

    e) Decl n ng to grant r ghts under trademark law for use of so 
    trade na s, trademarks, or serv ce marks; or

    f) Requ r ng  ndemn f cat on of l censors and authors of that
    mater al by anyone who conveys t  mater al (or mod f ed vers ons of
     ) w h contractual assumpt ons of l ab l y to t  rec p ent, for
    any l ab l y that t se contractual assumpt ons d rectly  mpose on
    those l censors and authors.

  All ot r non-perm ss ve add  onal terms are cons dered "furt r
restr ct ons" w h n t   an ng of sect on 10.   f t  Program as  
rece ved  , or any part of  , conta ns a not ce stat ng that    s
governed by t  L cense along w h a term that  s a furt r
restr ct on,   may remove that term.   f a l cense docu nt conta ns
a furt r restr ct on but perm s rel cens ng or convey ng under t 
L cense,   may add to a covered work mater al governed by t  terms
of that l cense docu nt, prov ded that t  furt r restr ct on does
not surv ve such rel cens ng or convey ng.

   f   add terms to a covered work  n accord w h t  sect on,  
must place,  n t  relevant s ce f les, a state nt of t 
add  onal terms that apply to those f les, or a not ce  nd cat ng
w re to f nd t  appl cable terms.

  Add  onal terms, perm ss ve or non-perm ss ve, may be stated  n t 
form of a separately wr ten l cense, or stated as except ons;
t  above requ re nts apply e  r way.

  8. Term nat on.

    may not propagate or mod fy a covered work except as expressly
prov ded under t  L cense.  Any attempt ot rw se to propagate or
mod fy    s vo d, and w ll automat cally term nate y  r ghts under
t  L cense ( nclud ng any patent l censes granted under t  th rd
paragraph of sect on 11).

  Ho ver,  f   cease all v olat on of t  L cense, t n y 
l cense from a part cular copyr ght holder  s re nstated (a)
prov s onally, unless and unt l t  copyr ght holder expl c ly and
f nally term nates y  l cense, and (b) permanently,  f t  copyr ght
holder fa ls to not fy   of t  v olat on by so  reasonable  ans
pr or to 60 days after t  cessat on.

  Moreover, y  l cense from a part cular copyr ght holder  s
re nstated permanently  f t  copyr ght holder not f es   of t 
v olat on by so  reasonable  ans, t   s t  f rst t     have
rece ved not ce of v olat on of t  L cense (for any work) from that
copyr ght holder, and   cure t  v olat on pr or to 30 days after
y  rece pt of t  not ce.

  Term nat on of y  r ghts under t  sect on does not term nate t 
l censes of part es who have rece ved cop es or r ghts from   under
t  L cense.   f y  r ghts have been term nated and not permanently
re nstated,   do not qual fy to rece ve new l censes for t  sa 
mater al under sect on 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Requ red for Hav ng Cop es.

    are not requ red to accept t  L cense  n order to rece ve or
run a copy of t  Program.  Anc llary propagat on of a covered work
occurr ng solely as a consequence of us ng peer-to-peer transm ss on
to rece ve a copy l kew se does not requ re acceptance.  Ho ver,
noth ng ot r than t  L cense grants   perm ss on to propagate or
mod fy any covered work.  T se act ons  nfr nge copyr ght  f   do
not accept t  L cense.  T refore, by mod fy ng or propagat ng a
covered work,    nd cate y  acceptance of t  L cense to do so.

  10. Automat c L cens ng of Downstream Rec p ents.

  Each t     convey a covered work, t  rec p ent automat cally
rece ves a l cense from t  or g nal l censors, to run, mod fy and
propagate that work, subject to t  L cense.    are not respons ble
for enforc ng compl ance by th rd part es w h t  L cense.

  An "ent y transact on"  s a transact on transferr ng control of an
organ zat on, or substant ally all assets of one, or subd v d ng an
organ zat on, or  rg ng organ zat ons.   f propagat on of a covered
work results from an ent y transact on, each party to that
transact on who rece ves a copy of t  work also rece ves whatever
l censes to t  work t  party's predecessor  n  nterest had or could
g ve under t  prev ous paragraph, plus a r ght to possess on of t 
Correspond ng S ce of t  work from t  predecessor  n  nterest,  f
t  predecessor has   or can get   w h reasonable efforts.

    may not  mpose any furt r restr ct ons on t  exerc se of t 
r ghts granted or aff r d under t  L cense.  For example,   may
not  mpose a l cense fee, royalty, or ot r charge for exerc se of
r ghts granted under t  L cense, and   may not  n  ate l  gat on
( nclud ng a cross-cla m or countercla m  n a lawsu ) alleg ng that
any patent cla m  s  nfr nged by mak ng, us ng, sell ng, offer ng for
sale, or  mport ng t  Program or any port on of  .

  11. Patents.

  A "contr butor"  s a copyr ght holder who author zes use under t 
L cense of t  Program or a work on wh ch t  Program  s based.  T 
work thus l censed  s called t  contr butor's "contr butor vers on".

  A contr butor's "essent al patent cla ms" are all patent cla ms
owned or controlled by t  contr butor, w t r already acqu red or

            How to Apply T se Terms to Y  New Programs

   f   develop a new program, and   want   to be of t  greatest
poss ble use to t  publ c, t  best way to ach eve t   s to make  
free software wh ch everyone can red str bute and change under t se terms.

  To do so, attach t  follow ng not ces to t  program.     s safest
to attach t m to t  start of each s ce f le to most effect vely
state t  exclus on of warranty; and each f le should have at least
t  "copyr ght" l ne and a po nter to w re t  full not ce  s found.

    <one l ne to g ve t  program's na  and a br ef  dea of what   does.>
    Copyr ght (C) <year>  <na  of author>

    T  program  s free software:   can red str bute   and/or mod fy
      under t  terms of t  GNU Affero General Publ c L cense as publ s d by
    t  Free Software Foundat on, e  r vers on 3 of t  L cense, or
    (at y  opt on) any later vers on.

    T  program  s d str buted  n t  hope that   w ll be useful,
    but W THOUT ANY WARRANTY; w hout even t   mpl ed warranty of
    MERCHANTAB L TY or F TNESS FOR A PART CULAR PURPOSE.  See t 
    GNU Affero General Publ c L cense for more deta ls.

      should have rece ved a copy of t  GNU Affero General Publ c L cense
    along w h t  program.   f not, see <https://www.gnu.org/l censes/>.

Also add  nformat on on how to contact   by electron c and paper ma l.

   f y  software can  nteract w h users remotely through a computer
network,   should also make sure that   prov des a way for users to
get  s s ce.  For example,  f y  program  s a  b appl cat on,  s
 nterface could d splay a "S ce" l nk that leads users to an arch ve
of t  code.  T re are many ways   could offer s ce, and d fferent
solut ons w ll be better for d fferent programs; see sect on 13 for t 
spec f c requ re nts.

    should also get y  employer ( f   work as a program r) or school,
 f any, to s gn a "copyr ght d scla  r" for t  program,  f necessary.
