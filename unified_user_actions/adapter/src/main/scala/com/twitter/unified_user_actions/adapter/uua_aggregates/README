Currently t  d r conta ns mult ple adapters.
T  goal  s s m lar: to generate Rekeyed (key by T et d) `KeyedUuaT et` events that can be
used for V ew Counts (aggregat on).

T  2 adapters:
1. Reads from UUA-all top c
2. Reads from  nteract onEvents
  have 2 adapters ma nly because currently  nteract onEvents have 10% more T etRender mpress ons
than what UUA has. Deta ls can be found at https://docs.google.com/docu nt/d/1UcEzAZ7rFrsU_6kl20R3YZ6u_Jt8PH_4-mVH 216eM/ed #

   s st ll unclear wh ch s ce should be used, but at a t   t re should be only one serv ce runn ng.
